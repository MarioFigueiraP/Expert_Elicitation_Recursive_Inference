# Integrating Expert Knowledge and Recursive Bayesian Inference

The scripts available in the repository allow for the reproduction of the examples presented in the article *"Integrating Expert Knowledge and Recursive Bayesian Inference: A Framework for Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Data Challenges"*. These are organized as follows:

1. [**Categorical aggregation**](./scripts/runme_Categorical_aggregation.R): 
2. [**Expert elicitation with spatial change of support**](./scripts/runme_Spatial_ChangeOfSupport.R):
3. [**Spatio-Temporal Temperature Example with Recursive Inference**](./scripts/runme_TemperatureSpatiotemporal_Recursive.R):
4. [**Spatio-Temporal Simulation Example with Recursive Inference**](./scripts/runme_Simulated_Spatiotemporal_Recursive.R):
