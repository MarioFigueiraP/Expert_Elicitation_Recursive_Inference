# Integrating Expert Knowledge and Recursive Bayesian Inference

The scripts available in the repository allow for the reproduction of the examples presented in the article *"Integrating Expert Knowledge and Recursive Bayesian Inference: A Framework for Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Data Challenges"*. These are organized as follows:

1. [**Categorical aggregation**](./scripts/runme_Categorical_aggregation.R):
2. [**Expert elicitation with spatial change of support**](./scripts/runme_Spatial_ChangeOfSupport.R):
3. [**Recursive inference for the spatio-temporal example**](./scripts/runme_Spatiotemporal_Recursive.R):
